# Automatic-Pet-Feeder (Final Project for intro to EE/CE in Fall 2023)
<p>Utilized an Ardunio to build a mock up for an automatic pet feeder. Access to Arduinos were limited so TinkerCAD was used to simulate the code written for menu functionality and proper dispensing of food. Physical protype was then made when materials were accessible.</p>
